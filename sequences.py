# we can fetch data by their appearance using [], eg the code below will return S
# name = "seteye"

# print(name[0])

# we have different types of sequences in python, one is List which is synonymous with arrays in other languages
# and is mutable

# cars = ["benz", "toyota", "lambo"]

# print(cars)

# another type of sequence in python is a tuple,we use ( ) to write a tuple and tuples do not change in value meaning they
# immutable

# point = (10, 23)

# another type of data type is set which is a collection of unique value, it is worthy to note that while list and tuple are orderly,
# set is not

#in other to check the length of any sequence we use len
